\paragraph{4.10} For the vector computer, the memory acess of the vector portion of codes requires $\frac{200 MB+100 MB}{20 GB/s}=10 ms$, and the execution of scalar portion of codes requires 400 ms. Suppose that vector computations are overlapped with memory acess, then the total time for the vector computer = 410 ms.

For the hybrid computer, the memory acess of the vector portion of codes requires $\frac{200 MB+100 MB}{150 GB/s}=2 ms$, and the execution of scalar portion of codes requires 400 ms, the I/O transering data from host memory to GPU local memory requires $\frac{200 MB+100 MB}{10 GB/s}=30 ms$. Suppose that GPU vector memory access is overlapped with memory transering, then the total time for the vector computer = 430 ms.

\subparagraph{a.} $1.5 GHz\times 0.85\times 0.8\times 0.7\times \frac{1}{4}\times 32\times 10 = 57.12$ GFLOP/s.
